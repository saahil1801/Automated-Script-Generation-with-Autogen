# Automated-Script-Generation-with-Autogen

This repository demonstrates a multi-agent system capable of generating scripts through collaboration between specialized AI assistants.

## What is AutoGen

AutoGen is a framework that enables the development of LLM applications using multiple agents that can converse with each other to solve tasks. AutoGen agents are customizable, conversable, and seamlessly allow human participation. They can operate in various modes that employ combinations of LLMs, human inputs, and tools.

## AutoGen Overview

AutoGen enables building next-gen LLM applications based on multi-agent conversations with minimal effort. It simplifies the orchestration, automation, and optimization of a complex LLM workflow. It maximizes the performance of LLM models and overcomes their weaknesses.
It supports diverse conversation patterns for complex workflows. With customizable and conversable agents, developers can use AutoGen to build a wide range of conversation patterns concerning conversation autonomy, the number of agents, and agent conversation topology.
It provides a collection of working systems with different complexities. These systems span a wide range of applications from various domains and complexities. This demonstrates how AutoGen can easily support diverse conversation patterns.
AutoGen provides enhanced LLM inference. It offers utilities like API unification and caching, and advanced usage patterns, such as error handling, multi-config inference, context programming, etc.
AutoGen is powered by collaborative research studies from Microsoft, Penn State University, and the University of Washington.

## Key Features:

Modular Agent Design: Each assistant has a distinct role (Content Creator, Script Writer, Researcher, Reviewer), fostering task-focused expertise.

Collaborative Dialogue: Agents engage in multi-turn conversations to achieve a shared goal, fostering knowledge exchange and refinement.

Integration with LM Studio: Leverages LM Studio for interaction management and large language model (LLM) access.

Flexible Task-Specific Guidance: Agents can be configured with distinct system messages to align with specific project goals.
